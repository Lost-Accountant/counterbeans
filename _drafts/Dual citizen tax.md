# **What if I am resident of 2 countries?**

I often encouter the following question:

> I am a US citizen living in Canada, so I am both a tax resident of US, due to citizenship, and a tax resident of Canada, due to residency. 
>
> Will I get double taxed?

No, you will not, and I will explain.

## Theory

It is acknowledged widely that the same income should not be taxed twice, thus tax treaties between countries are created.

For now, we will not discuss countries that do not have tax treaties with Canada.

### **International Tax Treaty**

Although almost all the personal income tax topics are goverened by the Income Tax Act, any international tax treaties actually are considered more important.

The treaties ensure that the same income or gains will **NOT taxed twice**, and the tax you will pay, in total, for your income or gains will be at the **highest rate** of the two countries invovled.

>$$ \sum{Tax(I)} = Tax_{A}(I) + Tax_{B}(I) = I * max(r_a, r_b) $$
>
> $$A$$, $$B$$ - Countries involved
>
> $$I$$ - Total income
>
> $$Tax_{i}(x)$$ - a function that determines total tax when given income level $$x$$, in country $$i$$.
>
> $$r_{i}$$ - tax rate for country $$i$$.

However, this is what the treaties aim to do, and reality is rarely perfect, so the actual total tax might be rather different, due to differences among nations' tax laws.


## Practice

International tax treaties determine *foreign nation's* (such as the United States, for dual citizens) right to tax certain types of income (that are taxable under that country's law), and the tax you paid towards *foreign nations* is then called **Foreign Tax Credits** that can be claimed in your Canadian personal (*T1*) income tax return.


(The following should probably be a separate section).

### Foreign Tax Credit

They usually arrive in 2 forms: One that brings you convenience and one that doesn't.

- Tax Slips (*T3*, *T5*, *T5013*)

    If your investment deals with foreign entities, such as a mutual fund that invests in American companies and receive dividends from America, which is subject to *withholding tax* paid to those foreign countries. (Please see "*Non-Resident*" for details).

    Your investments tax summary can arrive in the form of *T3*, *T5*, or *T5013* tax slips, depending on the type of investments.

    In those tax slips, foreign tax credits are already calculated for you, presented in a box with its box number. All you need to do is to just put the numbers in your tax software, matching the box number, and your tax software will automatically take care of the rest.

- No Tax Slips
