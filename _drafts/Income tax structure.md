# Structure of Personal Income Tax

## Definition of Income

A very important concept is that:

$$ Income \thinspace for \thinspace Accounting \neq Income \thinspace for \thinspace Tax $$

*Income for accounting purposes* is determined using the *Generally Accepted Accounitng Principles* (*GAAP*), which are *IFRS* and *ASPE* in the context of Canada. A significant intention for *GAAP* is to present the finanical stituations in a fair and faitful way that is accepted by most financial institutions, such as avoiding managers' incentive to over-state revenue earned for personal gains.

However, the Canada Revenue Agency has a different goal in mind. Its main purpose is to collect as much taxes from the taxpayers as possible, in order to fund all the other departments of the government. Thus, it does not really recognize *GAAP* income, but uses its own way to determine when revenue is recognized and taxable. This becomes more obvious once we move to Corporate Tax.
