# **What if I am resident of 2 countries?**

I often encouter the following question:

> I am a US citizen living in Canada, so I am both a tax resident of US, due to citizenship, and a tax resident of Canada, due to residency. 
>
> Will I get double taxed?

No, you will not, and I will explain.

## Theory

It is acknowledged widely that the same income should not be taxed twice, thus tax treaties between countries are created.

### **International Tax Treaty**

#### Implication
```
max tax rate
```

### **Countries with no treaties**


## Practice

### Foreign Tax Credit

### Recommendation
