# Am I Subject to Income Tax in Canada?

This is the 1st question that should be asked. Otherwise, there is no point reading further.

## Worldwide Income Taxable

Unlike the United States which determines whether you are subject to income tax on your *worldwide income* based on citizenship and residency, the only criteria used in Canada is your **residency** status.

In other words, in Canada tax system, you are subject to income tax for all income and gains originated anywhere in the globe, as long as you are a **resident of Canada**, even if you are **NOT a Canadian citizen**.

Otherwise, if you are not a resident, only specific activies occurred in Canada will be taxed.

## How do I know if I am a "Resident"

This is determined on a year-by-year basis and there are 2 ways of knowing it:

1. ***Deemed Resident***

    If you have stayed in Canada for **more than 182 days** in the **calendar year**.

2. ***Residency based on Common Law***

    Discussed further below.

### Mechanism
The process effectively works like this:

```
def Residency(individual):

    If (individual.stays > 182){
        return True;
    } else{
        return ResidencyCommonLaw(individual);
    }

```

### **Tax Residency under Common Law**

Your residential ties with Canada is defined as whether you have "continuing relationship with Canada".

In human language, it is judged based on the following factors:

(Text in *Italic* is how I personally call them).

1. **Significant Residential Ties**

    - Home in Canada.
    - Spouse or partner or children living in Canada.

    I personally call it the *family ties*.

2. **Secondary Residential Ties**

    - *Economic ties*
        - Personal properties in Canada. (e.g. cottage, car, ...)
        - Canadian bank account
        - Canadian credit card
    - *Social ties*
        - gym membership
        - professional organizations
        - religious groups
    - *Legal ties*
        - Canadian passport
        - Canadian driver license
        - Canadian provincial health card

**NOTE**: It does not mean that if you have a Canadian passport, you are a resident of Canada.

The residential ties above are factors used in court, so it is more of a judgement thing with no crystal-clear critiera, unlike the deemed resident rule.

In the court, other factors will also be considered such as motives, background, routine of life, and so on. 

Whether you are a resident is sometimes quite obvious, and sometimes not. ***If in doubt, consult a professional.***

### **Immigration & Emmigration**

In progress.
