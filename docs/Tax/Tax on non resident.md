# **Tax on Non-Resident**

It was mentioned that only certain activities are taxed when you are a non-resident, and those activities can be categorized into 2 types:

1. **Passive in nature**

    - Example:
        - *Dividend* from Canadian companies or ETFs
        - *Rent* from a Canadian properties
        - *Royalties* from Canada
        - *Pension* from Canada
    
    - Those activities will have **Witholding Tax** (**Part III tax**) deducted already when the income is paid to you, usually at **25%** but sometimes different based on the tax treaty signed between Canada and the country you are in. 

    - You don't need to worry about tax return in this case as it was withheld already.

2. **Active in nature**

    - Example:
        - *Business income* from Canada, through **Permanent Establishment** in Canada. (If no permanent establishment, not considered as business activity within Canada but an import.).
        - *Gains* from selling taxable Canadian properties. (Real Estate, shares of private corporations, investment in trust and partnership, and so on)
        - *Employment income* from Canada.
    
    - This is where it gets complicated and I will not elaborate further other than: please consult a professional. (Or maybe it will be updated in the future).
